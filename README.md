## University of Queensland - CSSE2310/CSSE7231 - Assignment 3 (Semester 1, 2022)

### Objective:
Develop two C programs - 'sigcat' and 'hq' - to demonstrate process management, communication concepts, and C programming skills. 'sigcat' is an enhanced version of the Unix utility 'cat', while 'hq' manages process lifecycle, input/output, and signals.
### sigcat:
Reads from stdin and writes to an output stream (stdout or stderr).
Signal handling functionality to switch output streams on receiving SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
### hq:
Reads commands from stdin to manage spawned processes.
Commands include spawning new processes, sending/receiving data and signals, and reporting status.

### Submission Requirements:
Source files and Makefile, excluding compiled files, to be submitted.
Code compilation with specific gcc options.
Submission via 2310createzip a3 command and zip file upload.
